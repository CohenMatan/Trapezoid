# Trapezoid
A program that reads from the user six integers. The first two numbers will indicate the X coordinate and the Y coordinate of the left point of one base of the trapezoid and the third number will indicate the length of that base. The next two numbers will indicate the X coordinate and the Y coordinate of the left point of the second base of the trapezoid and the sixth number will indicate the length of this base. It does not matter the order between the bases
